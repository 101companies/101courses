# Assignment for Course "Lambdas at UvA"

(C) 2016 http://softlang.org, Ralf Laemmel

## Simple assignment

See modules Fib.hs and Fuse.hs.

This assignment deals with basics of list processing, pattern matching, and recursion.

## Modest assignment

See module Map.hs.

This assignment models functions (maps) as lists of pairs.
We deal with the basic property of a list of pairs to constitute a function.

## Tough assignment

Read up on profiling (benchmarking) and take some measurements for the computation of the Fibonacci sequence (see simple assignment) or for the search/sorting algorithms of the lecture . You could look at different implementations of Fibonacci: the naive one with binary recursion and a more efficient one with extra parameters to suffice with linear recursion. Instead, you could compare different search and sorting algorithms or implementations thereof, e.g., binary search on lists versus binary search on actual trees.

Here is some course code (briefly mentioned in lecture) that also does pprofiling:
