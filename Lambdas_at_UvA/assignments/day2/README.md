## Simple assignment

See modules Fib.hs and Fuse.hs.

This assignment deals with basics of list processing, pattern matching, and recursion.

## Modest assignment

See module Map.hs.

This assignment models functions (maps) as lists of pairs.
We deal with basic properties of functions.

## Tough assignment

Read up on profiling (benchmarking) and take some measurements for the computation of the Fibonacci sequence (see simple assignment). You could look at different implementations of Fibonacci: the naive one with binary recursion and a more efficient one with extra parameters to suffice with linear recursion.
